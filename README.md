Hey! I'm [Maploop](https://github.com/Maploop), an avid Java / C++ programmer with tons of experience working on different projects. Although most of my projects are based in Java, I am also familiar with JS, Python, Rust and C#.

I'm a lead developer at [Atlas Network](https://discord.gg/paper) (9k+ members), where I manage and code alongside a development team of 8 - We have over 150,000 unique players log in and our codebase is over 1,000,000 LOC. I am also a former developer at [TrexMine](https://trexmine.com) which is the largest Iranian Minecraft server to date.
